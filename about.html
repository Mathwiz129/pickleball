    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Chattpickleball is a really barebones app built for a small group of Chattanooga-area players who just want to track games.
    It’s not meant for broad public use (at least not yet), but if you’ve stumbled across it you can definitely use it-just be careful.
    </p>
    <p>
     Technically, data is public. But there’s no search or indexing, and unless you’re poking around in developer tools, most info is hard to get to. It’s not secure in a traditional sense, but for our tiny use case, it's fine for now.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this ever does expand-adding logins, match verification, privacy layers-I’m open to it. But right now it’s a side project designed for a specific group. Feedback always welcome.
    </p>

    <h2>How Rankings Are Calculated</h2>
    <p>
      Each player’s rating is calculated on a <strong>scale from 1.00 to 10.00</strong>, based on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Win ratio</strong> (wins ÷ matches played)</li>
      <li><strong>Average scoring margin</strong> (points scored minus points allowed per match)</li>
      <li><strong>Match volume</strong> (slight penalty applied if fewer than 3 total matches)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The formula used to calculate each player’s rating is:</p>

    <pre style="background:#f9f9f9; padding:1em; border-radius:6px; overflow:auto;">
rating = 5 + ((winRatio - 0.5) × 10) + (avgMargin ÷ 5) - penalty
    </pre>

    <p><strong>Where:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>winRatio</code> = wins / total matches</li>
      <li><code>avgMargin</code> = (total points scored - total points allowed) / total matches</li>
      <li><code>penalty</code> = 1.0 if matches played &lt; 3, otherwise 0</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Ratings are clamped between <strong>1.00 and 10.00</strong> to keep things fair and intuitive.
      Players start near 5.00 and rise as they win with consistency and strong margins.
    </p>

    <h4>Example</h4>
    <p>
      If a player has played 8 matches with 6 wins, scored 88 points and allowed 64:
    </p>
    <pre style="background:#f9f9f9; padding:1em; border-radius:6px; overflow:auto;">
winRatio = 6 / 8 = 0.75
avgMargin = (88 - 64) / 8 = 3
rating = 5 + ((0.75 - 0.5) × 10) + (3 ÷ 5) = 8.10
    </pre>

    <p>
      If that same player had only played 2 matches, a 1.0 penalty would lower their rating to 7.10.
    </p>
